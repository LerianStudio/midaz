### 📋 Files to Create (REMAINING) - Not Required for Current Demo

All essential CRM functionality has been implemented using a simplified approach with mock data generators. The following files represent a more comprehensive architecture that could be implemented in future iterations:

```
/src/core/domain/entities/               # Domain-driven design entities (future enhancement)
/src/core/application/dto/               # Data transfer objects (future enhancement)
/src/core/application/mappers/           # Entity-DTO mapping (future enhancement)
/src/core/application/use-cases/         # Business logic layer (future enhancement)
/src/core/infrastructure/mock-crm/       # Repository pattern implementation (future enhancement)
/src/schema/                            # Advanced validation schemas (future enhancement)
```

**Note**: Current implementation uses simplified mock data approach which is sufficient for demo purposes and rapid development.

### Files Modified ✅ COMPLETED

```
/src/components/sidebar/index.tsx       # ✅ Added CRM navigation
/src/app/(routes)/page.tsx              # ✅ Added CRM dashboard widgets
```

**Note**: Account enhancement and container registry changes are planned for future integration phases.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Design System Integration

- **Colors**: Follow existing Midaz console theme
- **Typography**: Consistent with current font hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Use established spacing tokens
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons for consistency
- **Components**: Build on existing UI component library

### Customer-Specific UI Patterns

#### Customer Cards

```typescript
interface CustomerCardProps {
  customer: Customer
  showActions?: boolean
  compact?: boolean
}
```

#### Customer Status Indicators

- **Active**: Green badge with checkmark
- **Inactive**: Gray badge with pause icon
- **Pending**: Yellow badge with clock icon
- **Blocked**: Red badge with X icon

#### Customer Type Differentiation

- **Natural Person**: User icon, blue accent
- **Legal Person**: Building icon, purple accent

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile**: Single column layout with collapsible sections
- **Tablet**: Two column layout with optimized forms
- **Desktop**: Three column layout with side panels

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management

- **React Query**: For server state and caching
- **React Context**: For customer selection state
- **Local Storage**: For user preferences and filters

### Form Handling

- **React Hook Form**: Form state management
- **Zod**: Schema validation
- **Multi-step Forms**: Wizard navigation with validation

### API Integration (Mock)

```typescript
// Mock API endpoints structure
interface CRMApi {
  customers: {
    list: (params: PaginationParams) => Promise<PaginatedResponse<Customer>>
    getById: (id: string) => Promise<Customer>
    create: (data: CreateCustomerInput) => Promise<Customer>
    update: (id: string, data: UpdateCustomerInput) => Promise<Customer>
    delete: (id: string) => Promise<void>
  }
  aliases: {
    listByCustomer: (customerId: string) => Promise<Alias[]>
    create: (customerId: string, data: CreateAliasInput) => Promise<Alias>
    update: (id: string, data: UpdateAliasInput) => Promise<Alias>
    delete: (id: string) => Promise<void>
  }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large customer lists
- **Lazy Loading**: Component code splitting
- **Memoization**: Expensive calculations and renders
- **Debounced Search**: Reduce API calls during typing

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Component Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Form submission and validation
- **Visual Tests**: Storybook component documentation

### E2E Testing (Playwright)

```typescript
// Example E2E test scenarios
test.describe('Customer Management', () => {
  test('should create new individual customer', async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to customers page
    // Click create customer
    // Fill form steps
    // Verify customer creation
  })

  test('should link customer to account via alias', async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to customer detail
    // Create new alias
    // Select ledger and account
    // Verify alias creation
  })
})
```
