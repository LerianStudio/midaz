# Midaz Project Governance

Welcome to the Midaz Project Governance documentation. This document outlines our governance model, roles, responsibilities, and the procedures we follow to ensure a transparent and fair environment for every contributor.

## 1. Governance Model and Decision-Making Process

Midaz operates under a meritocratic governance model. Decisions are made based on discussion and consensus among community members. When consensus cannot be reached, decisions may be escalated to the Steering Committee, which will consider all viewpoints and make a decision in the best interest of the project.

### Decision-Making Process:

- **Discussion** : Proposals and ideas are discussed openly in project forums. Every community member is encouraged to voice their opinions and provide feedback.
- **Consensus** : Efforts are made to reach an agreement that is acceptable to all active participants.
- **Vote** : If consensus cannot be achieved, a formal vote is held among Maintainers or the Steering Committee to make a final decision.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers:

- **Responsibilities** : Reviewing code submissions, managing build processes, ensuring code quality and security, and mentoring new contributors.
- **Authority** : Can merge code changes and accept or reject contributions.

### Contributors:

- **Responsibilities** : Submitting bug reports, feature requests, and participating in the community discussions.
- **Authority** : Contributors do not have direct code merge authority but can suggest changes through pull requests.

### Steering Committee:

- **Responsibilities** : Overseeing the project’s strategic direction, resolving escalated issues, and making final decisions when consensus is not possible.
- **Authority** : Can override decisions, change governance rules, and resolve high-level conflicts.

## 3. Voting Procedures and Conflict Resolution

### Voting Procedures:

- **Eligibility** : All Maintainers are eligible to vote. For significant changes, a wider group may be included.
- **Method** : Voting typically takes place online via a transparent, accessible platform. Majority vote decides outcomes.

### Conflict Resolution:

- **Process** : In the event of a conflict, parties are encouraged to resolve disputes through direct communication and mediation by peers.
- **Escalation** : Unresolved conflicts may be escalated to the Steering Committee for final resolution.

## 4. Code of Conduct and Enforcement

Our [Midaz - Code of Conduct](https://github.com/LerianStudio/midaz-console/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is central to fostering an inclusive and productive environment. All community members are expected to follow the principles of respect, fairness, and openness.
