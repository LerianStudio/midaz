# Midaz Core-Banking Stack Installation Script
# ============================================================================
#
# This script provides an automated installation of the Midaz core-banking platform.
# It detects the operating system, installs dependencies, clones the repository,
# and sets up all required services using Docker containers.
#
# The installation is designed to be interactive by default but can be run in
# non-interactive mode by passing the -y flag. The script includes extensive
# error handling, recovery capabilities, and diagnostic information.
#
# Key Features:
# - Cross-platform support (Linux distributions and macOS)
# - Automatic dependency installation
# - Branch selection for different development environments
# - Optional demo data generation
# - Recovery from interrupted installations
# - Uninstallation capability
# - Comprehensive error diagnostics
#
# It performs the following actions:
#  1. Detects the operating system and package manager
#  2. Verifies required dependencies are installed:
#     - Git (for cloning the repository)
#     - Docker + Docker Compose (for containerization)
#     - Make (for running build processes)
#  3. Clones the Midaz repository (with branch selection)
#  4. Ensures Docker daemon is running
#  5. Starts the services using Docker Compose
#  6. Optionally generates demo data for testing
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://get.midaz.dev | sh
#   ./install.sh [OPTIONS]
#
# Common Options:
#   --help         Display help information
#   --uninstall    Remove Midaz from the system
#   -y, --yes      Non-interactive mode
#
# Configurable environment variables:
#   MIDAZ_DIR      Override installation directory (default: ~/midaz)
#   MIDAZ_REF      Branch/tag to clone (default: main)
#   INSTALL_FLAGS  Pass -y to skip interactive prompts (fully automated install)
#
# For developers:
# This script is designed to be maintainable and extensible. Each function has a
# single responsibility, and error handling is consistent throughout. The script
# includes state tracking to enable recovery from interruptions and diagnostics
# to help troubleshoot issues.

# Configuration and Safety Settings
# ============================================================================
#
# The script uses strict error handling to fail fast and provide clear feedback.
# Three options are enabled to ensure robust execution:
#
# set -e: Exits immediately if a command fails. This prevents the script from 
#         continuing after errors that might lead to incorrect installations.
#
# set -u: Treats unset variables as errors. This catches typos and ensures all
#         required variables are properly defined before use.
#
# set -o pipefail: Ensures that a pipeline fails if any command in it fails,
#                  not just the last one. This helps catch errors in piped commands.
#
# The script also sets a safe Internal Field Separator (IFS) to handle whitespace
# in filenames and paths correctly, preventing common filepath parsing errors.

# Enable strict mode for safer execution
# -e: Exit immediately if a command fails
# -u: Treat unset variables as an error
# -o pipefail: Ensures that a pipeline fails if any command in it fails
set -eu

# Set a safe Internal Field Separator (IFS)
# This ensures that whitespace in filenames and paths is handled correctly
IFS="$(printf '\n\t')"

# ============================================================================
# Default Configuration Variables
# ============================================================================
#
# These variables control the installation process and can be customized
# through environment variables or command-line flags.
#
# Users can override these settings either by:
# 1. Exporting them as environment variables before running the script
#    Example: MIDAZ_DIR=/opt/midaz curl -fsSL https://get.midaz.dev | sh
#
# 2. Using command-line arguments for the supported options
#    Example: ./install.sh --yes to enable non-interactive mode
#
# The script will always prioritize explicitly set variables over defaults.
# If a configuration variable is not set, the script will use these sensible defaults.

# Installation location - can be overridden by setting MIDAZ_DIR environment variable
# Default is in the user's home directory for unprivileged installation
MIDAZ_DIR="${MIDAZ_DIR:-$HOME/midaz}"

# Git reference (branch/tag) to install - can be overridden by setting MIDAZ_REF
# Users can specify a different branch for development/testing purposes
MIDAZ_REF="${MIDAZ_REF:-main}"

# Repository URL - this is the official Midaz repository
# This is the canonical source for the Midaz core-banking platform
MIDAZ_REPO="https://github.com/lerianstudio/midaz"

# Flag to track if we're running in non-interactive mode
# This is set to 1 when -y or --yes flag is passed
MIDAZ_AUTOCONFIRM=0

# Installation flags from environment - used to enable non-interactive mode
# Typically set to "-y" to automatically confirm all prompts
INSTALL_FLAGS="${INSTALL_FLAGS:-}"

# Branch selection timeout (in seconds)
# How long to wait for user input when selecting a branch before defaulting to main
BRANCH_SELECTION_TIMEOUT=10

# ============================================================================
# Installation State Tracking and Recovery
# ============================================================================
#
# The script maintains a state file to track installation progress, allowing
# for recovery if the process is interrupted. This is particularly useful for
# long installations or when network interruptions occur.
#
# State tracking works by:
# 1. Saving the current state to a temporary file after completing each major step
# 2. Checking for this state file on startup to detect interrupted installations
# 3. Offering to resume from the last completed step rather than starting over
#
# The state file is cleaned up after successful installation, but persists
# if the installation is interrupted, allowing for recovery later.
#
# States tracked include:
# - not_started: Fresh installation, no previous state found
# - deps_installed: Dependencies successfully installed
# - repo_cloned: Repository successfully cloned
# - services_started: Docker services successfully started
# - completed: Installation completed successfully

# Define the state file path
MIDAZ_STATE_FILE="/tmp/midaz_install_state.tmp"

# Function to save the current installation state

# Signal Handling and Cleanup
# ============================================================================
#
# This section defines how the script responds to various signals, ensuring
# graceful termination even when interrupted. The cleanup function is called
# whenever the script exits abnormally, providing users with information about
# the interrupted state and saving progress for later recovery.
#
# Signal traps handle:
# - INT: Keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
# - TERM: Termination signal sent by system
# - EXIT: Any exit from the script (unless trap is reset)
# - HUP: Terminal disconnect (hangup)
#
# The cleanup function:
# 1. Saves the current installation state to enable recovery
# 2. Provides clear messaging about the interrupted installation
# 3. Gives instructions for resuming the installation later

# This function handles interruption signals to ensure clean termination
# If the user presses Ctrl+C or the script receives a termination signal,
# this ensures we exit gracefully instead of leaving partial installations
cleanup() {
  # If we have a current state, save it to allow for recovery
  if [ -n "${CURRENT_INSTALL_STATE:-}" ]; then
    save_state "${CURRENT_INSTALL_STATE}"
    echo "[MIDAZ] Installation state saved for recovery."
  fi
  
  echo "[MIDAZ] Installation interrupted. Exiting..."
  echo "[MIDAZ] You may need to manually clean up any partially installed components."
  echo "[MIDAZ] Run the installer again to attempt recovery."
  exit 1
}

# Set traps for various signals:
# INT: Keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
# TERM: Termination signal
# EXIT: Script exit
# HUP: Terminal disconnection
trap cleanup INT TERM EXIT HUP

# We'll reset the EXIT trap at the end of successful installation
# This prevents the cleanup function from running on normal exit
trap '' EXIT

# ============================================================================
# Logging Functions
# ============================================================================
#
# These functions provide consistent messaging throughout the script.
# Each function has a specific purpose to help users
# distinguish between different types of information:
#
# - log: Standard informational messages
# - log_success: Success messages for completed operations
# - log_warning: Warning messages for potential issues
# - log_error: Error messages for problems that prevent continuing
# - die: Fatal error handler that exits with detailed diagnostic information
#
# Using consistent log functions improves readability and makes it easier
# to filter or parse the output programmatically if needed.
#
# The die() function is especially important as it collects system information
# for troubleshooting before exiting with a non-zero status code.

# Standard informational message
log() {
  echo "[MIDAZ] $1"
}

# Success message for completed operations
log_success() {
  echo "[MIDAZ] SUCCESS: $1"
}

# Warning message for potential issues that don't stop installation
log_warning() {
  echo "[MIDAZ] WARNING: $1"
}

# Error message for issues that prevent continuing
# Outputs to stderr to differentiate from regular output
log_error() {
  echo "[MIDAZ] ERROR: $1" >&2
}

# Fatal error handler - logs error, collects system information for debugging,
# and exits with a non-zero status code
die() {
  log_error "$1"
  # Provide detailed system information to help with troubleshooting
  echo "\nDiagnostic Information (please include in any support requests):"
  echo "===================================================================="
  
  # OS release information if available
  if [ -f /etc/os-release ]; then

  echo "===================================================================="
  exit 1
}

# ============================================================================
# User Interaction Functions
# ============================================================================
#
# These functions handle user interactions throughout the installation process.
# They provide a consistent way to request input from users while supporting
# both interactive and non-interactive modes.
#
# The prompt() function is particularly important as it:
# 1. Shows a prompt to the user requesting confirmation
# 2. Skips the prompt entirely in non-interactive mode (auto-confirms)
# 3. Handles various affirmative responses (y, yes, or just Enter)
# 4. Returns standardized exit codes for consistent handling (0 for yes, 1 for no)
#
# This design allows the same code to work in both interactive installations 
# (where users can make choices) and automated deployments (where default or
# specified choices are used automatically).

# Prompts the user for confirmation to proceed with an action
# Returns 0 (success) if user confirms or we're in autoconfirm mode
# Returns 1 (failure) if user declines
prompt() {
  # Skip prompting if we're in non-interactive mode
  if [ "${MIDAZ_AUTOCONFIRM}" -eq 1 ]; then
    log "Auto-confirming: $1"
    return 0
  fi
  
  # Otherwise, ask the user and wait for their response
  printf "[MIDAZ] %s" "$1"
  read -r response
  case "${response}" in
    [yY]|[yY][eE][sS]|"")
      # User confirmed (y, yes, or just pressed Enter)
      return 0
      ;;
    *)
      # User declined
      return 1
      ;;
  esac
}

# ============================================================================
# Privilege Escalation Functions
# ============================================================================
#
# These functions handle running commands with elevated privileges when necessary.
# The script always tries to minimize the use of sudo/doas by:
# 1. Checking if the command can be run without privileges
# 2. Using user-specific alternatives when available (e.g., --user flag)
# 3. Only escalating privileges when absolutely necessary
#
# This approach follows the principle of least privilege and makes the script
# safer to run. When privilege escalation is needed, the script:
# 1. Detects the appropriate command (sudo, doas, or none if already root)
# 2. Provides clear messaging about why elevated privileges are needed
# 3. Handles errors gracefully with helpful guidance for common issues
#
# The run_sudo() function has special handling for common commands like Docker,
# apt, and systemctl to avoid unnecessary privilege escalation.

# Determines the appropriate privilege escalation command to use (if any)
# Returns the command name (sudo, doas) or empty string if already root
get_sudo() {
  if [ "$(id -u)" = 0 ]; then
    # We're already running as root, no need for sudo/doas
    echo ""
    return 0
  elif command -v sudo >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # sudo is available, prefer this
    echo "sudo"
    return 0
  elif command -v doas >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # doas is available (common on OpenBSD and some security-focused systems)
    echo "doas"
    return 0

# ============================================================================
# Dependency Checking Functions
# ============================================================================
#
# These functions verify that required dependencies are available and meet
# version requirements. The script uses a modular approach to dependency checking:
#
# 1. check_command() - Verifies if a command exists in the system PATH
# 2. check_version() - Compares version numbers to ensure minimum requirements are met
# 3. verify_installation() - Validates that an installation was successful
#
# For version checking, the script includes fallback mechanisms to handle various
# version string formats. This makes the version detection more robust across
# different implementations of the same tool.
#
# If dependencies are missing or outdated, the script offers to install them
# automatically (with user confirmation in interactive mode). This reduces the
# manual setup required from users.

# Checks if a command is available in the current PATH
# Returns 0 (success) if command exists, 1 (failure) if not
check_command() {
  command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1

# Docker Management Functions
# ============================================================================

# using the appropriate method for the detected operating system.

# Repository Cloning
# ============================================================================
#
# This section handles cloning or updating the Midaz repository. It includes
# interactive branch selection to allow users to choose which version of the
# codebase to install.
#
# Key features:
# - Fetches available branches from GitHub
# - Displays branches with main and develop prioritized
# - Allows selection by number or name with a timeout
# - Defaults to the main branch for stability
# - Uses single-branch cloning for efficiency
# - Handles repository updates if already cloned
#
# The branch selection is especially useful for developers who want to install
# specific versions or features that are still in development.
