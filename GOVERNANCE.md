# Midaz Project Governance

This document outlines our governance model, roles, responsibilities, and procedures. We maintain a transparent and fair environment for every contributor.

## 1. Governance Model and Decision-Making Process

Midaz operates under a meritocratic governance model. We make decisions based on discussion and consensus among community members. When consensus cannot be reached, the Steering Committee considers all viewpoints and decides in the best interest of the project.

### Decision-Making Process:

* **Discussion:** We discuss proposals and ideas openly in project forums. Every community member can voice their opinions and provide feedback.
* **Consensus:** We work to reach an agreement acceptable to all active participants.
* **Vote:** If consensus cannot be achieved, Maintainers or the Steering Committee hold a formal vote to make a final decision.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers:

* **Responsibilities:** Review code submissions, manage build processes, ensure code quality and security, and mentor new contributors.
* **Authority:** Merge code changes and accept or reject contributions.

### Contributors:

* **Responsibilities:** Submit bug reports, feature requests, and participate in community discussions.
* **Authority:** Contributors do not have direct code merge authority but can suggest changes through pull requests.

### Steering Committee:

* **Responsibilities:** Oversee the project's strategic direction, resolve escalated issues, and make final decisions when consensus is not possible.
* **Authority:** Override decisions, change governance rules, and resolve high-level conflicts.

## 3. Voting Procedures and Conflict Resolution

### Voting Procedures:

* **Eligibility:** All Maintainers are eligible to vote. For significant changes, a wider group may be included.
* **Method:** Voting takes place online via a transparent, accessible platform. Majority vote decides outcomes.

### Conflict Resolution:

* **Process:** In the event of a conflict, parties should resolve disputes through direct communication and mediation by peers.
* **Escalation:** Unresolved conflicts may be escalated to the Steering Committee for final resolution.

## 4. Code of Conduct and Enforcement

Our [Midaz - Code of Conduct](https://github.com/LerianStudio/midaz/v3/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is central to fostering an inclusive and productive environment. All community members follow the principles of respect, fairness, and openness.
