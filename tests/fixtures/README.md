Fixtures contain sample payloads and canonical shapes derived from the OpenAPI specs in components/onboarding/api and components/transaction/api. These are intended as starting points for integration and e2e tests and will be adjusted as validations evolve.

Conventions:

- Values like IDs and aliases are placeholders; tests should inject dynamic, unique values at runtime when needed.
- Keep only minimal required fields for successful creation; optional fields can be added by specific tests.
