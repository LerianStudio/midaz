# Midaz: Next-Gen Open-Source Ledger

Midaz is an open-source ledger system that is part of a Core Banking Platform being developed by Lerian. The ledger and the other components of the platform are currently UNDER CONSTRUCTION and should not be used in production.

Midaz is designed to address the limitations of traditional ledger systems and provide a comprehensive, multi-asset, multi-currency, and immutable ledger solution for the modern financial landscape.

## Understanding Core Banking

At Lerian, we view a core banking system as a comprehensive platform consisting of four main components:

1. **Ledger (Core)**: The central database that manages all transactions and accounts. This is where Midaz plays a crucial role, serving as the foundation of the core banking system.

2. **Transactional Services**: These generate debits and credits in the ledger. Examples include instant payments (like PIX in Brazil), card transactions, and wire transfers.

3. **Governance**: This component includes integrations for onboarding, anti-fraud/AML measures, management reporting, regulatory compliance, and accounting.

4. **Connectivity Infrastructure**: This provides the necessary (if any, since most advanced regional financial systems are moving to the cloud) physical connections to external systems and networks.

Our open-source approach allows developers to integrate Midaz seamlessly with other components, creating a complete core banking solution tailored to their specific needs. Whether you're building a new financial product, modernizing legacy systems, or creating innovative fintech solutions, Midaz provides the solid foundation you need for your core banking infrastructure.

Lerian is committed to also providing a robust set of Transactional Services and Governance integrations to complement Midaz. More to come soon.
