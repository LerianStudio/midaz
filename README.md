**Midaz** is an open source ledger designed to offer multi-asset and multi-currency transaction capabilities within a single, natively immutable and fully auditable platform.

It supports complex "n:n" transactions, with multiple senders and receivers within the same registry, and facilitates direct exchanges between assets and/or currencies in one go. The solution is built on a double-entry chart-of-accounts engine, enhancing the accounting process and ensuring seamless integration with financial reports.

By adhering to these guiding principles, Midaz offers a robust ecosystem that is not only powerful and efficient but also aligned with the best practices in software architecture. Our commitment to these values ensures that Midaz remains a cutting-edge solution for developers seeking to build scalable, resilient, and adaptable applications.
